# Insanity

Insanity is a Minecraft modpack for 1.12. It is currently in an early alpha status. The main gimmicks are tons of 9x9 crafting recipes, recipes that involve the quest book, and hundreds of custom blocks and items.

The goal is to kill the Ender Dragon. This will be nearly impossible.
